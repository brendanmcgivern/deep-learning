## Planar data classification with a hidden layer

### This course was taught by Andrew Ng and is part of the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

### This was the second programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you I generated red and blue points to form a flower. I then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. I experimented with different layers to see the results.
